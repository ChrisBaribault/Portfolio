    <p><a href="http://www.merciatouristboard.org.uk/">Merica Tours</a> , has a lot going on once you open up their page. It uses a lot of vibrant colors, hard to read fonts and multiple images. Which ends up making a very chaotic website. This is a great lesson in which less is more.
        There is a ton of content on the website but it's all shoved together on the homepage which makes it hard to pick out aspects that you may want to read and explore.</p>
        <p>What this website could have done is made some of the information not as cluttered together because if the website has too much it overwhelms the reader. It's not only that but the reader won't take the time to read through the information.
             It will make the webpage hard to navigate.</p>
             <p>A good example is <a href="https://group.bishamon-ten.com/daikokuya/littletokyo/&opi=79508299">Bishamon Group</a>. This webpage has a very traditional look to it. It may be a dark color with different kinds of fonts but the white of the text makes the letters stand out. I enjoy the typeface that Bishamon used for their name because it's very reminiscent of an old Japanese writing tool, yatate, which ties into the company's culture. But the web page is easy to navigate and easy for most people to read.
                This means most people will take their time to read it carefully and know the information.
             </p>
             <p>Fonts are very important in web pages because you want the reader to know what they are reading and not overwhelm their eyes because if you give a website different fonts and colors it's going to strain their eyes and they won't want to read your webpage.
                So things like kerning, point sizes and monospaced are important; it spaces the characters out so they aren't all close together and hard to read. It also makes sure that fonts are the same size.
