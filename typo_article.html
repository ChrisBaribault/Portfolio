    <p><a href="http://www.merciatouristboard.org.uk/">Merica Tours</a> , has a lot going on once you open up there page. It uses a lot of vibrant colors, hard to read fonts and multiple images. Which ends up making a very chaotic website. This is a great lesson in which less is more.
        There is a ton of content on the website but its all shoved together on the homepage. Which makes it hard to pick out aspects that you may want to read and explore.</p>
        <p>What this website could have done is made some of the information not as cluttered together because if the website has to much it overwhelms the reader. Its not only just that but the reader wont take the time to read through the information.
             It will make the webpage hard to navigate.</p>
             <p>A good example is <a href="https://group.bishamon-ten.com/daikokuya/littletokyo/&opi=79508299">Bishamon Group</a> this webpage has a very traditional look to it. It may maybe a dark color with different kinds of fonts. But the web page is easy to navigate and easy for most people to read.
                which means most people will take there time to read it carefully and know the information. 
             </p>
             <p>Fonts are very important in webpages cause you want the reader to know what the are reading and not overwhelming there eyes cause if you give a website different fonts and colors its gonna strain there eyes and they wont want to read your webpage.
                so things like kerning, point sizes and monospaced are important it spaces the characters out so they aren't all close together and hard to read. It also makes sure that fonts are the same size.
