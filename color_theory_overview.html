      <h3>What is Color Theory?</h3>
      <p>Color Theory is the Study of how colors work together and how they effect our Emotions and Perceptions.
        Colors have a deep meaning to many cultures. 
        Not understanding how colors are viewed by different countries could have a negative effect on how you want your information, products, ect. to be percevied. 
        Color Theory is like a toolbox for artists, designers, and creators to help them choose the right colors for their projects. 
        Enables you to pick colors that go well together and convey the right mood or message in your work.
