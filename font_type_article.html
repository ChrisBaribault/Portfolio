    <p><b>DaFont:</b> had some of my favorite fonts Ive seen they are very artistic and fancy. For example: Donuts King is very bold and reminds me of paint and very smooth, while Velista is very skinny but has a very fancy look to it.
        As you can see Above. 
       They are also free to use, but make sure you read that it says free for personal use. 
       Since some are not all free to use.</p>
        <p>Link to website: <a href="https://www.dafont.com/">DaFont.com</a></p>

   <p><b>1001 Fonts:</b> Works the same way as , but has some different options each website has different fonts. For example: Sars Fect is very Sci-fi font and Finesolla reminds me of a wedding invitation. as you see Above. 
       But always be sure to check and read before downloading.</p>
